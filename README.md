### **HR Analytics – Predicting & Preventing Employee Attrition**

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Employee turnover significantly impacts organizations through recruitment costs, productivity loss, and workflow disruption.
This project aims to:

✔ Understand patterns and key reasons behind employee attrition<br>
✔ Identify at-risk employees proactively<br>
✔ Build predictive ML models to support HR decision-making<br>
✔ Provide dashboards & insights to help implement retention strategies<br>

---

# 📌 **Business / Real-Life Use Cases**

### **1. Employee Retention**

Detect employees likely to leave & take preventive actions (bonuses, role changes, training).

### **2. Cost Optimization**

Reduce hiring, onboarding, and training costs caused by high attrition.

### **3. Workforce Planning**

Identify departments or roles with high turnover & improve HR policies.

### **4. Performance Management**

Predict performance ratings to plan promotions or training programs.

### **5. HR Strategy Development**

Use analytics-based insights instead of assumptions.

# 🧠 **Approach (Step-by-Step)**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

* Load dataset (Excel)
* Remove unnecessary constant columns
* Handle missing values & outliers
* Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding
* Normalize numerical features with StandardScaler
* Balance target using SMOTE

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Attrition distribution
* Salary vs attrition
* Overtime impact
* Department-wise attrition
* Age/Experience vs job satisfaction

### **3. Feature Engineering**

* Tenure buckets
* Work-life balance indicators
* Promotion gap features
* Manager relationship indicators

### **4. Model Building**

Models used:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest Classifier ✔ (best performance)

Evaluation metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* AUC-ROC
* Confusion Matrix

### **5. Dashboard & Visualization**

Built using **Streamlit**:

* Real-time Attrition Prediction
* Performance Rating Prediction
* HR Recommendations
* Interactive forms
* Automated insights

---

# 📊 **Results**

### ✔ **Predictive Accuracy**

* Achieved high accuracy (>85% in balanced conditions).
* Random Forest outperformed other models.

### ✔ **Key Attrition Drivers**

* Overtime
* Low Job Satisfaction
* Low Salary
* Long commute distance
* Poor work-life balance
* Years since last promotion

### ✔ **At-Risk Employee Identification**

* Model provides probability of attrition
* HR can prioritize retention efforts

### ✔ **Visual Dashboards**

* Streamlit app gives real-time predictions
* Easy interface for HR teams
